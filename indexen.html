  <section id="history">
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      The very first revenue in the history of the business came from the Russian Embassy in Greece in 2018. This was for a mapping application created to honor the Russian victims of the Second World War, in the Greek area. During that period there wasn't any specific brand. The app remained online for some time, during the start of the recent war conflicts, it was eventually retired from the embassy’s webpage.
      <br><br>
      That small yet significant project was the beginning of the a little map’s journey. Since then, operations have expanded through collaborations with various public sector bodies of Greece, primarily via registrations as an individual professional. At the same time, the business has grown its international presence by engaging diverse clients worldwide through platforms like Upwork.
      <br><br>
      In 2020, the brand “a little map” was officially registered with the Athens Chamber of Commerce.
